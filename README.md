# GOYO  
### An AI-Based Active Noise Control System for Smart Home Environments

---

## Proposal

This project proposes **GOYO**, a prototype smart home application integrating AI-driven sound analysis and IoT-based active noise control. The system detects and classifies low-frequency noise (20â€“250 Hz) generated by household appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators. Using a trained model, GOYO predicts repetitive noise patterns and generates phase-inverted audio signals through connected smart speakers to actively cancel noise in real time.

Users can monitor the noise environment through a mobile dashboard, connect microphones and speakers, and select modes (Work, Study, Movie) that adjust ANC parameters automatically. The system architecture will integrate Python-based ML models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) with IoT device APIs such as LG ThinQ or Google Home.

This research aims to demonstrate how AI sound classification and predictive modeling can enhance user comfort and concentration in everyday smart home environments by transforming passive devices into an adaptive, noise-aware ecosystem.
